              <h3 class="text-center"> Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin boxing world champion </h3>
              <p> One of the worlds best middlewight boxer with a streak of 23 knock outs and he is known as GGG. Golovkin is a great example or role model. He has 41 fights in total, 39 wins, 35 knock outs, 1 loss,and 1 draw. I have a lot of respect for professional boxers and more respct of GGG. Boxing is one of the hardest sports and being so good at it like him is so hard. Golovkin is known for his exceptionally powerful and precise punching, balance, and methodical movement inside the ring. Golovkin stated that he as one of the most durable chins in all boxing history. he has had 391 fights, 350 as an amature and 41 as a profssional. he is also named the third most active boxer last year and this year.</p>
